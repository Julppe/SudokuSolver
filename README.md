# SudokuSolver
Sudoku solver using open CV and recursive backtracking.


Created model training data using image combinedtraining1.png.
Works with screenshots from website: https://alypaa.com/sudoku

SudokuSolve.py takes the name of the image file as an input and outputs a solution into the console.
